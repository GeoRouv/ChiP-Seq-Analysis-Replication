# Replicate-ChiP-Seq-Analysis
In this project i replicated a ChiP-Seq analysis from an experiment regarding gene induction and repression during terminal erythropoiesis are mediated by distinct epigenetic changes

## Tools you'll need:

* Python 2.7.1
* Samtools 1.11 (Utility)
* Bedtools 2.27.1 (Utility)
* FastQC 0.11.9 (Quality Control)
* Minion (Adapter Prediction)
* Cutadapt 1.9.1 (Adapter Trimming)
* Bowtie 1.0.0 (Alignment)
* MACS 1.4.1 (Peak Calling)
* MEME 5.0.2 (Motif analysis)
